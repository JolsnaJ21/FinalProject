    " ### Problem Description:\n",
    " \n",
    "Natural language processing (NLP) is becoming increasingly important in health and healthcare. NLP helps in assisting the physicians in making decisions, predicting health outcomes, preventing unpleasant events, and improving quality of treatment by converting unstructured data into structured / standardised data. AI advancements employing pre-trained transformer topologies have revolutionised NLP in recent years. These advances have enabled researchers to create generalizable language models and use them to obtain higher accuracy on future downstream tasks. Pre-trained transformer designs have since become commonplace for language tasks including contextual long-distance dependencies, and have been integrated into commercial services such as Google Search and Amazon Alexa.\n",
    "\n",
    "Considering recent achievements, clinical abbreviations and acronyms, continue to hamper NLP performance and practical use in health and healthcare. Abbreviations account for 30-50% of clinical language, such as doctor's notes, but barely 1% of general literature, such as news media. As a result, recognising, disambiguating, and extending abbreviations is critical in clinical NLP, and even little improvements would increase performance and practical applicability. Furthermore, recognising, disambiguating, and extending abbreviations can assist physicians, nurses, carers, and patients in understanding them, which has been demonstrated in trials to prevent medically-harmful misinterpretation."

    "### Context of the Problem:\n",
    "\n",
    "Recognising, disambiguating, and expanding medical abbreviations and acronyms is critical for preventing medically-dangerous misinterpretation in natural language processing. We give the medical abbreviation and Acronym Meta-Inventory, a comprehensive database of medical abbreviations, to aid in recognition, disambiguation, and growth.  A comprehensive harmonisation of eight source inventories from a variety of healthcare disciplines and contexts yielded 104,057 abbreviations and 170,426 related senses. Cross-mapping of synonymous records automaticallyUsing cutting-edge machine learning minimises redundancy, simplifying future applications.\n",

    "### Limitation About other Approaches:\n",
    "\n",
    "Two fundamental challenges stand in the way of compiling a comprehensive sense inventory are :- \n",
    "1. faults have been identified in multiple sources, necessitating the use of quality control to correct them. \n",
    "2. Since abbreviations differ depending on expertise and setting, many individual sense inventories from various specialties and settings are required. \n",
    "\n",
    "The use of multiple inventories raises the chance of significant redundancy, necessitating cross-mapping (internal structure) to eliminate redundancy and facilitate future application. Due to the combinatorial nature of the problem, the number of comparisons increases exponentially with the number of records, making manual cross-mapping impractical. <br>"
